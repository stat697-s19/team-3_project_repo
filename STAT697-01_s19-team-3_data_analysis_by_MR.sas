Question: Can the % of "Education" under "Contribution of deprivation in 
dimension to overall poverty" be used to predict the country's "Multidimensional 
Poverty Index"?

Rationale: A correlation between the percent of education and the MPI will 
determine if education really is a significant agent to combat poverty.

Note: This compares the column "Contribution of deprivation in dimention to 
overall poverty" from 2018 Statistical Annex Table 6 to the column 
"Multidimensional Poverty Index" from 2018 Statistical Annex Table 6.

Limitations: missing values need to be addressed for glm and general data analysis

Question: Is there a strong association between "Mean years of schooling" by 
country for both M and F and the "Human Development Index"?

Rationale: A strong assocation would show whether the HDI is appropriately 
measured by the years of schooling and not by national income or life 
expectancy and vice versa.

Note: This compares the column "Mean years of schooling" from 2018 Statistical 
Annex Table 4 to the column "Human Development Index" from 2018 Statistical 
Annex Table 4.

Question: Is there a negative correlation between countries with a greater % of 
"Inequality of Education" and "Human Development Index" and does this 
correlation follow a similarly negative correlation with "Inequality in life 
expectancy"

Rationale: This would help to show whether life expectancy can forecast 
"expected" education and if that "expected" education contributes to the HDI.

Note: This compares the column "Inequality of Education" from 2018 Statistical 
Annex Table 3 to the column "Human Development Index" from 2018 Statistical 
Annex Table 3.
